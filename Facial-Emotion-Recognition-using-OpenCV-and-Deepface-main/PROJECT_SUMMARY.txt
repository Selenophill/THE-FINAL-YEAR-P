# Facial Emotion Detection System - Project Summary

## Overview
Real-time facial emotion recognition system achieving 87.40% accuracy on test data.

## Key Features
- Multi-face detection with real-time emotion classification
- Ensemble approach using 4 emotion models with majority voting
- Web-based interface for live monitoring
- Database storage for detected faces
- 7 emotion categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Neutral

## Technical Implementation
- **Face Detection**: MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)
- **Emotion Recognition**: Ensemble of 4 models (FER2013, FER+, AffectNet, RAF-DB)
- **Prediction Method**: Majority voting with score averaging
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
